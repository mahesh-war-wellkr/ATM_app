# ATM_app
I have created an ATM application in Atm_app.c
In which the main function are as follows:
1. Load cash to ATM
2. show Customer Details
3. Show ATM operations
4. Quit app

I have created a function for all the above and added sub functions in Show ATM operations 

In Show ATM operations added functions are as follows:

1. Account Balance
2. Cash Withdrawal
3. Transfer money
4. Check  ATM Balance
5. Show mini Statement
6. Quit process

Also I added more functions for saving and loading data files, which are as follows:
1. atm_data text file
2. customer_data text file
3. 101_transaction text file
4. 102_transaction text file
5. 103_transaction text file
6. 104_transaction text file
7. 105_transaction text file
